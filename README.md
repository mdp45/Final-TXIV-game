#Final Project - Electroball Toss

This is a skill base projectile shooter loosely based on the Worms game and Cats VS Dog game. 
Unlike Cat vs Dog, you have movement controls on your character like worms;
Movement allows you to reposition you character so your opponent has to vary his shot strength every turn.
You have to shoot a projectile over the wall to damage your opponent, the wall prevents you from making easy direct shots at your opponent.Projectile force can be controlled by charging up the strength of your shots. The win condition of the game is knocking a player out by fully depleting his hitpoints.

##Notes

* Make sure to updated the meeting notes from the scrum meeting outside of class.
* When work is finished, and milestones completed, strikethrough the requirement line to show progress,  ~~such as this~~
* You have to write a completed by: for each strikethrough.
* Example: ~~"Prepare health manager and mechanism for all relavant players to have a health component - Omar"~~ Completed by John Doe.
* Your requirements and intended features may change during scrums. Make sure you update this Readme if that happens(I support active change in reqs).
* Make sure you attend class regularly and show me the completed requirements in class. I will be interviewing teams every Saturday for grading purposes.
* Individual grading criteria: Saturday interviews, github commits, eventual team review form.
* Group Grading criteria: The usual grading criterial at the end of the project.(Fun to play, no bugs, Good contextual art, other minor things).
* You have been allocated Git LFS storage space on GitHub. You must use it if you intend to upload large files.
